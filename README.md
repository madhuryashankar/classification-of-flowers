# classification-of-flowers

This project presents classification of flowers using Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). In this study, the performance of CNN for
flower identification using its images is investigated. Publicly available dataset, namely Flower Recognition dataset, have been used for
the training and testing purposes. CNN has been proven to produce
excellent results for object recognition but its performance can still
be influenced by the type of images and the number of layers of the
CNN architecture. Experimental results indicate that the utilization
of the images of flowers arrive to the highest accuracy of 80% respectivel
